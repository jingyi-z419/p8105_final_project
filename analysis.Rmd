### Loading and tidying the data

We fetched the data from an API as shown in the code below and called it ny_cost.
This dataset which contains information from year 2015-2017 is a portion of the original dataset. 

```{r}
ny_cost = 
  GET("https://health.data.ny.gov/resource/7dtz-qxmr.csv",
      query = list("$limit" = 342913)) %>% 
  content("parsed")
```

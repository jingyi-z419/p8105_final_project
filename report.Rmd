## Motivation

Mental health disorders, including clinical depression, manic depression, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, account for several of the top causes of disability in the United States and worldwide. An estimated 26% of Americans ages 18 and older -- about 1 in 4 adults -- suffers from a diagnosable mental disorder in a given year. As residents-to-be, we are collectively interested in investigating the risk factors that contribute to mental health disorders in New York State and hopefully providing some insightful analysis on mental health related concerns in this COVID-19 era. *[Cited from JHU Medicine](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/mental-health-disorder-statistics#:~:text=An%20estimated%2026%25%20of%20Americans,substance%20abuse%20and%20anxiety%20disorders.)

### Load and tidying the dataset

```{r load_clean_data, message = FALSE}
ny_local = 
  read_csv("./data/ny_local.csv")

covid_symptom_df =
  read_csv("./data/Anxiety_Depression.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(state == "New York") %>% 
  mutate(
    indicator_id = case_when(
      indicator == "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder" ~ "Anxiety",
      indicator == "Symptoms of Anxiety Disorder or Depressive Disorder" ~ "Anxiety/Depressive",
      indicator == "Symptoms of Depressive Disorder" ~ "Depressive"
  ))

mental_care_df =
  read_csv("./data/Mental_Health_Care.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  filter(state == "New York") %>% 
  mutate(
    indicator_id = case_when(
      indicator == "Needed Counseling or Therapy But Did Not Get It, Last 4 Weeks" ~ "No Therapy",
      indicator == "Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks" ~ "Therapy",
      indicator == "Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health And/Or Received Counseling or Therapy, Last 4 Weeks" ~ "Med/Therapy",
      indicator == "Took Prescription Medication for Mental Health, Last 4 Weeks" ~ "Med"
    )
  )
```

The main dataset used for this project was [500 Cities: Local Data for Better Health, 2019 release](https://chronicdata.cdc.gov/500-Cities/500-Cities-Local-Data-for-Better-Health-2019-relea/6vp6-wxuq). The 500 Cities project is a collaboration between CDC, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and the CDC foundation. It aims to provide city and census tract-level small area estimates for chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive service use for the largest 500 cities in the United States. 

For this project, we used the complete dataset of the 500 Cities project 2019 release. It contains information recorded from 2016-2017. We filtered the original dataset so that it includes data for New York state only. The filtered dataset was named as ny_local, it was saved as a csv file and uploaded to the project repository on Github. 

The ny_local dataset contains `r ncol(ny_local)` columns and `r nrow(ny_local)` rows. There were `r sum(is.na(ny_local))` missing values in the dataset. Majority of these NAs were not in the main variables of interest. Thus, we decided to keep those values for plots and remove them for statistical analysis. 

Besides the main dataset, we included two more datasets related to the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. Those two datasets can be accessed through [Indicators of Anxiety or Depression COVID-19](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp) and [Mental Health Care COVID-19](https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Mental-Health-Care-in-the-Last-4-Weeks/yni7-er2q). The indicators of Anxiety or Depression dataset was named as covid_symptom_df and the Mental Health Care dataset was named as mental_care_df.

The covid_symptom_df contains `r ncol(covid_symptom_df)` columns and `r nrow(covid_symptom_df)` rows. 
The mental_care_df contains `r ncol(mental_care_df)` columns and `r nrow(mental_care_df)` rows. There were `r sum(is.na(mental_care_df))` missing values in the dataset. Since the missing values were not in the variables of interest, we decided to keep them. 

*All datasets used for this project can be downloaded at [Github project repo](https://github.com/jingyi-z419/p8105_final_project), in the data folder.*
